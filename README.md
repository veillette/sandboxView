## Customizing the Default Video Library

Edit `src/data/videos.json` to change the default videos:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "XqZsoesa55w",      // YouTube video ID
    "title": "Baby Shark",    // Display title
    "emoji": "🦈",            // Thumbnail emoji
    "color": "#FF6B6B"        // Card background color
  }
]
```

### Finding YouTube Video IDs

The video ID is the 11-character code in YouTube URLs:

- `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqZsoesa55w` → ID: `XqZsoesa55w`
- `https://youtu.be/XqZsoesa55w` → ID: `XqZsoesa55w`

## YouTube Player Configuration

The player uses these safety parameters:

```javascript
{
  rel: 0,              // Don't show related videos from other channels
  modestbranding: 1,   // Minimal YouTube branding
  controls: 1,         // Show play/pause controls
  disablekb: 1,        // Disable keyboard shortcuts
  fs: 0,               // Disable fullscreen button (already fullscreen)
  iv_load_policy: 3,   // Hide video annotations
  playsinline: 1,      // Play inline on iOS
  showinfo: 0,         // Hide video title bar
  origin: '<app-url>'  // Security origin
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Videos Won't Play

- Ensure the YouTube video ID is correct
- Some videos have embedding disabled by the uploader
- Check your internet connection

### App Won't Install as PWA

- Must be served over HTTPS (except localhost)
- Clear browser cache and try again
- Some browsers require visiting the site multiple times

### Parental Gate Not Working

- Ensure JavaScript is enabled
- Try the alternative "hold button" method
- Clear app data and reload

### Player Controls Not Visible

- Tap the video area to show controls
- YouTube's built-in controls appear at the bottom

## Browser Support

- Chrome 80+
- Safari 14+ (iOS 14+)
- Firefox 80+
- Edge 80+

## Security Notes

- Videos are stored locally in browser storage
- No data is sent to external servers (except YouTube for playback)
- The parental gate is a deterrent, not a security measure
- For maximum safety, combine with OS-level parental controls
